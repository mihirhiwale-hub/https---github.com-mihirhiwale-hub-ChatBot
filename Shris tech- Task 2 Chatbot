TASK 2: AI-Powered Chatbot (Rule-Based + ML)
Task Name

AI-Powered Chatbot using Rule-Based and Machine Learning Approach

Objective

To develop a simple chatbot that can understand user input and respond automatically using predefined rules and a basic machine-learning intent classification model.

Description

The AI chatbot is designed to simulate a simple conversation with users.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the user’s intent and respond accordingly.

The chatbot works in two parts:

Rule-based system

Handles specific commands like time and date.

Machine-learning system

Uses Naive Bayes classification to identify user intent.

Responds to greetings, help requests, thanks, and basic questions.

The chatbot runs in a console interface where the user types messages and receives responses.

Output (Example)
Chatbot started! Type 'exit' to stop.

You: hello
Bot: Hello! How can I help you?

You: who are you
Bot: I am an AI chatbot created for Task-2 project.

You: time
Bot: 14:35:21
